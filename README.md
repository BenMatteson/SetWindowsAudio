SetWindowsAudio is a simple AHK Script that adds hotkey support for setting audio devices in windows

requires AutoHotkey software available here: https://www.autohotkey.com/

Set the desired hotkeys or use the defaults, and set the name(s) of the device(s) you want to select.
Device names can be customized in the properties window of the device.
In the case of duplicate names, the first is always selected, so generic names like "Speakers" don't work well.
