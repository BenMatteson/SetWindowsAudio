#SetWindowsAudio
AHK Script that adds hotkey support for setting audio devices in windows
requires AutoHotkey software available here: https://www.autohotkey.com/

Set the desired hotkeys or use the defaults, and set the device numbers you want to select.
To determine the device numbers, open the sound control panel by typing sound or mmsys.cpl in the start menu.
Then counting from the top starting with 1, pick the device you want for each(or either) of output and input devices. 
(you can also count from the bottom and enter it as a negative number, which may allow more reliable hotkeys if your lsit of devices is prone to change)
